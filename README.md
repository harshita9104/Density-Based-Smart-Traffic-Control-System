# Slot-Machine

Text based slot machine where user deposits a certain amount of money allowing them to bet on either one of the lines of slot machine, making them play until they run out of money.

The way it will work is:-

1. We need to collect the user's deposit, we need to add that to their balance.

2. We need to allow them to bet on a line or on multiple lines.

3. We then need to see if they actually got any of those lines.

4. Then spin the slot machine.

5. Generate different items that are going to be in the slot machine.

6. Then we need to add whatever they won back to their balance.
